{"name":"Hookjs","tagline":"A simple hooks system for JavaScript.","body":"### Welcome to HooksJS.\r\nThis is a simple little project that gives you a `Hooks` object for registering actions and filters for your scripts. It is loosely based on the WordPress hooks system (hence similar naming) and from other implementations that I have seen around.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThis project originally started its life as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/rheinardkorf/c6592b59fb061f9f8310). It was a proof of concept for creating WordPress like hooks in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n### Plans\r\nTo be honest, the WordPress legacy is nice because it makes the concept clear for WordPress developers, however, I am not overly fond of the method names and I am most likely going to change a number of things.  For the sake of backwards compatibility, I will keep the original four methods, but map them to newer methods.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOriginally created in 2015 by @rheinardkorf.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
